The company was founded by Val Leon, a Los Angeles based software engineer. V ran track and cross-country in High School and college and holds
several city titles and a state championship in cross-country. Here is he's story.
</P>
<Ul>
<li>
 Cat 3 road cyclist, winning races for a local Los Angeles based team, and California Cross Country State Champion.
</li>
<li>
 Had to stop cycling due to injury incurred from years of hard training.  Before it was understood that cross training and other factors are key.
</li>
<li>
 V has a love affair with riding bikes, working out, as well as, commuting to beat traffic and be one less car on the road.
</li>
<li>
 After undergoing his first knee surgery, to no avail, he had a hard time not getting into his bike.  He tried stem cells and it was too slow of a process. so he underwent the knife to get back into the saddle asap.
</li>
<li>
 He recovered and rode again but the knee was not improving.  aside from hopping on the saddle to get a workout he also uses it to commute to and from work.  He was frustrated driving a car for just a few miles to get to and from work and dealing with traffic.
</li>
<li>
 He then thought if I canâ€™t pedal much then I should get an electric bike
</li>
<li>
 Searched around to purchase one but none were to par in terms of power capability and sleak design.
</li>
<li>
 With an engineering mind, he decided to make his own, as if he was going out there, as a serious cyclist, looking for a powerful, fast and sexy bike.
</li>
<li>
 Thats when thunder bike was born.  Thats what thunderbike is all about
</li>
